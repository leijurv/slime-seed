Slime Chunk to Seed Finder

This relies on weaknesses in Minecraft's algorithm to determine where a hostile
creature, slimes, can spawn. This pattern is determined by the secret "seed" value
of the world.

The tool can be compiled by running:

    make

You can then do a run against a list of known spawning chunks for any given world
in "chunks.txt". These must be filled in for the world whose seed you want to
discover.

From there, you can run it with:

    make run

The file output.seeds will be filled with at most 100,000 possible values for the
lower 48 bits of the seed.

If the seed was randomly generated by the Minecraft server itself (rather than
supplied externally) then there will be relatively few possible 64-bit seeds for
any given lower 48 bits. This is because it only uses 48 bits of entropy when
selecting a random seed. The file likely.seeds will contain these expanded 64 bit
seeds.
