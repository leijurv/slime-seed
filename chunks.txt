slime chunks

# First line is a marker, tells us we've got a file of the right type.

# We provide the *chunk* X and Z coordinates in the exact
# spot where a slime spawned. These can be seen as "cx" and "cz"
# in the F3 debug screen.
# 
# Note they can move, you need the spot where they initially appeared.
# Fenced off, well lit areas containing only a single chunk are useful
# for this.

# Enter chunk coordinates where slimes seen (positive and negative) like this:
cx+12 cz-14
cx+0 cz-100
cx-123 cz+123
