slime chunks

# First line is a marker, tells us we've got a file of the right type.

# We provide the *chunk* X and Z coordinates in the exact
# spot where a slime spawned. These can be seen as "cx" and "cz"
# in the F3 debug screen. These are a 16th of the x and z coordinates
# so don't put those in by mistake!
# 
# Note they can move, you need the spot where they spawn, not move to.
# Fenced off, well lit areas containing only a single chunk are useful
# for confirming that they did in fact spawn within a given chunk.

# Enter chunk coordinates where slimes seen (positive observations) like this:
cx+12 cz-14
cx+0 cz-100
cx-123 cz+123

# We can't determine enough usefully from slimes *not* appearing somewhere -
# ignore chunks where they don't appear.
